## Notes

Using XCode for the first time was quite the challenge as well as coding on a Mac. I'm very used to programming on a PC however with Mac, my issues are everything is a lot condense and small so, it is tough to read or see what I'm coding. I wish I could have done more to make this app more unique to my sense of style, however I've been very occupied with work and school that I'm not left with a lot of time. I plan to be very creative and unique with the upcoming projects we will be doing in this course!
